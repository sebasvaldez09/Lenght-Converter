# Lenght-Converter

You are asked to write a program to receive a length expressed in feet, convert it to yards, and show the result on the screen.
The formula for converting a length expressed in feet to yards is:

length in yards = 1/3 x length in feet

To solve this problem your program must perform the following tasks:
// Declare variables called len_feet and len_yards that hold double precision real numbers.
// Prompt the user to enter the length in feet.
// Get the length from the keyboard and store it in the corresponding variable.
// Calculate the length in yards using the formula exactly as provided above and assign the result to the corresponding variable.
// Display on the screen the following message:
// "Hi" //
// len_feet, " feet are equal to ", len_yards, " yards

Test:
Please enter a lenght expressed in feet: 9.2
Hi
9.2 feet are equal to 3.06667 yards
